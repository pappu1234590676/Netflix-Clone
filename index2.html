            Great entertainment thrills and inspires. It sparks laughter, tears, gasps and sighs, stirring our emotions and nourishing our spirit. Ever since humans learned to speak, storytelling has been essential to our happiness.
            At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the worldâ€”creating great stories from anywhere and offering greater choice and control for people everywhere.
